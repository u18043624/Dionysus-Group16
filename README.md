
OVERVIEW:
As a team, Dionysus, we have set out to create a database and web application
that has been implemented in order to allow for wine tourists and winery
owners to sign-up and log-in as users in order to use our platform. Our
intuitive and easy-to-use interface prioritises user-friendliness, offering a
seamless experience and enhancing our aim to promote South Africa as a
desirable wine tourism destination and facilitate cultural exchange, economic
growth, and employment opportunities within the country's wine industry. This
adds to bridging the advancing world of technology to wine tourism making this
a desired and great change to the field
