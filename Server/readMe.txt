Which would be where the index.js is located.
Which is inside the server folder.

You want to run the following command in your terminal
NB: this will install all the required node_modules as they are listed in package.json
-----------------
npm install

This should install all the required node_modules. Then you can start the server.

Then Start Node server with

-------------------
node index.js
